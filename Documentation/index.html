   <h2>About XThreads</h2>
   <p>It's really difficult to explain XThreads in a simple manner.  You can somewhat think of it as a tool to allow admins to perform a higher level of customisation on their forum.</p>
   <p>Perhaps <a href="http://www.14.mynie.co.cc/">some</a> <a href="http://mybbhacks.zingaburga.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=24">examples</a> of what can be achieved with this plugin will give you an idea of what this can do.  Note that this plugin doesn't actually do much itself - you use it more like a tool.</p>
   
   <h2>Using XThreads</h2>
   <p><a href="http://mybbhacks.zingaburga.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=31">Some example usages can be found here</a> (and if you have any interesting usages, I kindly ask you to share them with everyone else).  Those examples are probably the best way to start understanding how XThreads works in general.</p>
   <p>I've tried to include some long-ish descriptions in many parts of the plugin, hopefully meaning that you won't need to refer to this document much.  As for this documentation, I will only really be focusing on <a href="undoc.html">stuff not documented in the interface</a>.</p>
   <p>In other words, you probably shouldn't be using this documentation to read up on how to really use this plugin, rather, it's more a reference to undocumented features.</p>
   
   <h2>This Documentation</h2>
   <p>...currently only has <a href="undoc.html">one other page</a>.  Maybe I'll expand it a bit more in the future.</p>
